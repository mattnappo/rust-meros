it is 1 of 2 problems

1: My operation dispatcher/executor is broken (the stack/vec of operations is removing things too quickly)
2: I am putting code where it shouldn't be. should it be in the behavior? an event? impl somewhere? etc...

There seems to just be some sort of issue with the floodsub stuff. Maybe upgrade to gossipsub to be able to get those error messages / status on the messages sent.

goal for when i wake up: just try to get the floobsub working. try to get a singular message to send. why did it work that one time when it almost crashed my pc?

maybe play around with the floodsub chat program and see what the effect of removing the dialing part does?

also jsut read thru the example source side by side and make sure im not just being dumb at pattern matching (copying the code)
